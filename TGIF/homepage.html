                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Openness, accountability, and honesty define government
                    transparency.
                    In a free society, transparency is
                    government's obligation to share information with citizens. It is at the heart of how citizens hold
                    their
                    public officials accountable. Here at TGIF we believe that government should be transparent.<span
                        id="dots1">...</span></p>

                <p><span id="more1">Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how officials conduct the
                        public
                        business and spend
                        taxpayer money must be readily available and easily understood. This transparency allows good
                        and
                        just
                        governance. Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about
                        what
                        their
                        Government is doing.
                        We also believe that government should be participatory. Public engagement
                        enhances
                        the Government's
                        effectiveness and improves the quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely dispersed in
                        society,
                        and
                        public officials benefit from having access to that dispersed knowledge. We invite you to use
                        our
                        site
                        to
                        become actively engaged in American government.
                        TGIF works to disclose information in forms that the public can readily find and
                        use.
                        We solicit public
                        feedback to identify information of greatest use to the public.</span></p><button

                <h3>Background History of Government Transparency</h3>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px">In the West, the idea that government should be open to public
                    scrutiny and susceptible to public opinion
                    dates back at least to the time of the Enlightenment, when many philosophes made an attack on
                    absolutist
                    doctrine of state secrecy, a core part of their intellectual project. The passage of formal
                    legislative
                    instruments to this end can also be traced to this time with Sweden, for example, (which then
                    included
                    Finland as a Swedish-governed territory) enacting free press legislation as part of its
                    constitution
                    (Freedom of the Press Act, 1766). This approach, and that of the philosophes more broadly, is
                    strongly
                    related to recent historiography on the eighteenth-century public sphere.

                        Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America (1776) and France (1789),
                        freedom of
                        the
                        press enshrined provisions and requirements for public budgetary accounting and freedom of
                        the press
                        in constitutional articles. In the nineteenth century, attempts by Metternichean statesmen to
                        row
                        back
                        on
                        these measures were vigorously opposed by a number of eminent liberal politicians and
                        writers,
                        Bentham,
                        Mill and Acton prominent among the latter.

                        Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary
                        democratic
                        practice and is often
                        linked to the passing of freedom of information legislation. Scandinavian countries claim to
                        have
                        adopted the first freedom of information legislation, dating the origins of its modern
                        provisions to
                        the
                        eighteenth century and Finland continuing the presumption of openness after gaining
                        independence
                        in
                        1917, passing its Act on Publicity of Official Documents in 1951 (superseded by new
                        legislation
                        in
                        1999).

                        The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in 1966,
                        FOIAs,
                        Access to Information
                        Acts
                        (AIAs) or equivalent laws were passed in Denmark and Norway in 1970.
